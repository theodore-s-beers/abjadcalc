                  I would strongly encourage anyone who knows an Arabic-script
                  language to learn how to type in it. This isn’t as difficult
                  as one might imagine&#x200A;—&#x200A;especially on mobile
                  devices, whose support for various languages is now often more
                  seamless than that of desktop operating
                  systems&#x200A;—&#x200A;and it opens up a whole new world of
                  resources online. However, if you would like to use this
                  <em>abjad</em> calculator but cannot type your input directly,
                  there are a couple of alternatives. First, Google has
                  developed clever tools for both

                    >Arabic</a
                  >
                  and
                  <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/intl/fa/inputtools/try/"

                    >Persian</a
                  >
                  that allow you to enter a phonetic approximation of your
                  intended words in Latin script, and then transliterate them
                  with little fuss. You could use one of these tools and
                  copy-paste the result into the box above. The second fallback
                  option is actually a <a href="ime/">separate version</a> of
                  this page, in which buttons may be used to enter Arabic or
                  Persian words one letter at a time.

                  By default, this program will assign an <em>abjad</em> value
                  of 1 to the isolated form of <em>hamzah</em> (ء), treating it
                  the same as if it were placed on an <em>alif</em>. Since this
                  is not a universally agreed-upon practice, there is a checkbox
                  to allow for the isolated <em>hamzah</em> to be ignored in
                  calculation. (Please refer to the following section for more
                  information on this dilemma and others like it.)

                  I’ve set the default letter values according to the more

                  to the Maghribi order using a checkbox, for those who need it.

                  More broadly, the program is designed to ignore any character
                  that it doesn’t recognize. If you enter a string of text
                  containing one or more extraneous characters, you’ll see a

                  <em>hā’</em>. (See the following note for the reasoning here.)
                  Also, if you are among the stubborn few who use the Unicode
                  character <code>06C0</code> (ۀ) to represent

                  is most troublesome of all, since it appears in conjunction
                  with several different letters. But we need only continue to
                  prioritize form. <em>Hamzah</em> on <em>wāw</em> (ؤ) is given
                  the value of <em>wāw</em> (6). <em>Hamzah</em> on
                  <em>yā’</em> (ئ) is given the value of <em>yā’</em> (10). Any
                  variant of <em>hamzah</em> on <em>alif</em>, unsurprisingly,
                  receives a value of 1. Finally, as has been explained above,
                  this program <em>does</em> assign a value of 1 to the isolated
                  form of <em>hamzah</em> (ء), which is most often found at the
                  end of certain Arabic words. This is a contested point; a few
                  of the guides that I consulted state explicitly that
                  <em>hamzah</em> by itself should not be counted, since the
                  appropriate value would come from the letter on which it is
                  seated. In the end, I followed position of the Baha’i
                  community. It has long been symbolically important in their
                  faith that the name Bahā’ (بهاء) has an <em>abjad</em> value
                  of 9, which requires that the final <em>hamzah</em> be
                  counted. Users who don’t want this feature can disable it.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                  It bears emphasis that any form of <em>alif</em> will be given
