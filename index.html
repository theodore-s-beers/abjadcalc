                I would strongly encourage anyone who knows an Arabic-script
                language to learn how to type in it. This isn’t as difficult as
                one might imagine&#8202;—&#8202;especially on mobile devices,
                whose support for various languages is now often more seamless
                than that of desktop operating systems&#8202;—&#8202;and it
                opens up a whole new world of resources online. However, if you
                would like to use this <em>abjad</em> calculator but cannot type
                your input directly, there are a couple of alternatives. First,
                Google has developed clever tools for both
                <a
                  href="https://www.google.com/intl/ar/inputtools/try/"
                  rel="noopener"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Arabic</a
                >
                and
                <a
                  href="https://www.google.com/intl/fa/inputtools/try/"
                  rel="noopener"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Persian</a
                >
                that allow you to enter a phonetic approximation of your
                intended words in Roman script, and then transliterate them with
                little fuss. You could use one of these tools and copy-paste the
                result into the box above. The second fallback option is
                actually a <a href="ime/">separate version</a> of this page, in
                which buttons may be used to enter Arabic or Persian words one
                letter at a time.
              </li>
              <li>
                By default, this program will assign an <em>abjad</em> value of
                1 to the isolated form of <em>hamzah</em> (ء), treating it the
                same as if it were placed on an <em>alif</em>. Since this is not
                a universally agreed-upon practice, there is a checkbox to allow
                for the isolated <em>hamzah</em> to be ignored in calculation.
                (Please refer to the following section for more information on
                this dilemma and others like it.)
              </li>
              <li>
                I’ve set the default letter values according to the more common
                “Eastern” convention. There is now an option to switch to the
                Maghribi order using a checkbox, for those who need it. Please
                refer to <a href="table/">this table</a> for a reminder of the
                differences between the two systems. (Only you can determine
                which of them is required by your sources.)

              <li>
                More broadly, the program is designed to ignore any character
                that it doesn’t recognize. If you enter a string of text
                containing one or more unrecognized characters, you’ll see a
                brief error message, followed by the total <em>abjad</em> value
                of the parts that
                <em>were</em> counted&#8202;—&#8202;<em>i.e.</em>, our best
                guess. It may be correct nonetheless…
              </li>
              <li>
                I recommend that you not include punctuation, or diacritics, or

                >, or anything else outside of the “base letters.” Only the last
                category is counted in the <em>abjad</em> system, anyway, so why
                add complication?

                The treatment of the four “Persian
                letters”&#8202;—&#8202;<em>pe</em>, <em>che</em>, <em>zhe</em>,
                and <em>gāf</em>&#8202;—&#8202;is, in fact, well established.
                Please refer to the same Wikipedia entry. In general, there
                should be no problem using Persian text. (Urdu? Pashto? You’re
                on your own for the time being.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Actually, there is one potentially confusing point in Persian:
                the
                <a
                  href="https://sites.la.utexas.edu/persian_online_resources/phonology/silent-letters-silent-and-consonantal/"

                  >silent <em>hā’</em></a
                >. But the answer is to treat this letter as we would any other
                <em>hā’</em>. (See the following note for the reasoning behind
                this.) Also, if you are among the stubborn few who use the
                Unicode character <code>06C0</code> (ۀ) to represent
                <em>iżāfah</em> on a silent <em>hā’</em>, that will be
                recognized just the same.
              </li>
              <li>
                This program treats the Arabic letter
                <a
                  href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A9"

                >
                as if it were <em>hā’</em> and assigns it a value of 5. This is
                due to a general principle in <em>abjad</em> calculation, that
                we judge letters by their <em>form</em> (<em>rasm</em>), rather
                than by their pronunciation or other factors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similarly,

                is considered equivalent to <em>yā’</em> and assigned a value of
                10. (Deal with it!)
              </li>
              <li>
                The treatment of
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza"
                  rel="noopener"
                  target="_blank"
                  ><em>hamzah</em></a
                >
                is most troublesome of all, since it appears in conjunction with
                several different letters. But we need only continue to
                prioritize form. <em>Hamzah</em> on <em>wāw</em> (ؤ) is given
                the value of <em>wāw</em> (6). <em>Hamzah</em> on
                <em>yā’</em> (ئ) is given the value of <em>yā’</em> (10). Any
                variant of <em>hamzah</em> on <em>alif</em>, unsurprisingly,
                receives a value of 1. Finally, as was explained in the prior
                section, this program <em>does</em> assign a value of 1 to the
                isolated form of <em>hamzah</em> (ء), which is most often found
                at the end of certain Arabic words. This is a debated point; a
                few of the guides that I consulted are adamant that
                <em>hamzah</em> by itself should not be counted, since the
                appropriate value comes from the letter on which it is seated.
                In the end, I took the position of the Baha’i community. It has
                long been symbolically important in their faith that the name
                Bahā’ (بهاء) has an <em>abjad</em> value of 9, which requires
                that the final <em>hamzah</em> be counted. Users who don’t want
                this feature may disable it with the relevant checkbox.
              </li>
              <li>
                I should emphasize that any form of <em>alif</em> will be given
                a value of 1. This includes
                <a
                  href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maddah"
                  rel="noopener"
                  target="_blank"
                  ><em>alif maddah</em></a
                >, which some have treated as a “double
                <em>hamzah alif</em>&thinsp;” with a value of 2. Here we may
                invoke another general principle of <em>abjad</em> numerals:
                each letter is counted exactly once. Just as
                <a
                  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadda"
                  rel="noopener"

                  ><em>shaddah</em></a
                >
                is not taken into consideration, nor should
                <em>alif maddah</em> be granted double value.
