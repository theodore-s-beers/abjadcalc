        <h4>Usage Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This follows the the common "eastern" convention. If you're working with Maghribi or otherwise nonconformist sources, then you're likely to get incorrect results. Sorry! I may try to add options at some point. (See below for more detail on the exact rules being observed.)</li>
            <li>Feel free to include spaces between words, or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">zero-width non-joiners</a>; they won't affect the calculation.
            </li>
            <li>More broadly, this program is designed to ignore any character that it doesn't recognize. If you enter text that contains one or more unrecognized characters, you'll see a brief error message, followed by the total <em>abjad</em> value of the parts that <em>were</em> counted (<em>i.e.</em>, our best guess). It may be correct nonetheless…</li>
            <li>I recommend that you not include punctuation, or diacritics, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_alif" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dagger <em>alif</em>s</a>, or anything else outside of the "base letters." Only the last category is counted in the <em>abjad</em> system, anyway, so why add complication?
            </li>
            <li>If you're confident that you entered valid text in Arabic or Persian script, but you still received an error message, please let me know <a href="mailto:tbeers@uchicago.edu">by email</a>. It might be a bug! (There are guaranteed to be some at this stage.)
            </li>

        <h4>Specific Rules Followed</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The basics of <em>abjad</em> numerals are covered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this Wikipedia entry</a>, and they are observed here faithfully. If one digs a bit deeper, however, questions and ambiguities may arise…
            </li>
            <li>The treatment of the four "Persian letters" (<em>p</em>, <em>ch</em>, <em>zh</em>, <em>g</em>) is, in fact, well established; it's explained in the same Wikipedia entry. There should be no problem using Persian text. (Urdu? Pashto? You're on your own, at least for the time being.)</li>
            <li>Actually, there is one potentially confusing point in Persian: the <a href="https://sites.la.utexas.edu/persian_online_resources/phonology/silent-letters-silent-and-consonantal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">silent <em>hāʾ</em></a>. But the answer is to treat this letter as we would any other <em>hāʾ</em>. (See the following note for the reasoning behind this.) Also, if you are among the proud few who use the Unicode character <code>06C0</code> (ۀ) to represent <em>iżāfah</em> on a silent <em>hāʾ</em>, that will be recognized just the same.
            </li>
            <li>This program treats the Arabic letter <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A9" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>tāʾ marbūṭah</em></a> as if it were <em>hāʾ</em> and assigns it a value of 5. This is due to a general principle in <em>abjad</em> calculation, that we judge letters by their <em>form</em>, rather than by their pronunciation or other factors.
            </li>
            <li>Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabic/LearnRW/alif_Maksoorah" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>alif maqṣūrah</em></a> is considered equivalent to <em>yāʾ</em> and assigned a value of 10. (Deal with it!)
            </li>
            <li>The treatment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>hamzah</em></a> is most troublesome of all, since it appears in conjunction with several different letters. But we need only continue to prioritize form. <em>Hamzah</em> on <em>wāw</em> (ؤ) is given the value of <em>wāw</em> (6). <em>Hamzah</em> on <em>yāʾ</em> (ئ) is given the value of <em>yāʾ</em> (10). Any variant of <em>hamzah</em> on <em>alif</em>, unsurprisingly, receives a value of 1. Finally, this program <em>does</em> assign a value of 1 to the standalone <em>hamzah</em> (ء), which is most often found at the end of certain Arabic words. This is a debated point; a few of the guides that I consulted were adamant that <em>hamzah</em> by itself should not be counted, since the appropriate value comes from the letter on which it is seated. Ultimately, I took the position of the Baha'i community. It has long been symbolically important in their faith that the name Bahāʾ (بهاء) has a numerical <em>abjad</em> value of 9, which requires that the final <em>hamzah</em> be counted. Good enough for me…
            </li>
            <li>I should emphasize that any form of <em>alif</em> will be given a value of 1. This includes <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maddah" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>alif maddah</em></a>, which some people have treated as a "double <em>hamzah</em>" with a value of 2. But here we may invoke another general principle of <em>abjad</em> numerals: each letter is counted exactly once. Just as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadda" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>shaddah</em></a> is not taken into consideration, nor should <em>alif maddah</em> be granted double value.
            </li>
        </ul>
