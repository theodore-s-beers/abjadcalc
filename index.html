  <h4>Usage Notes</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>This follows the the common "eastern" convention. If you're working with Maghribi or otherwise nonconformist sources, then you're likely to get incorrect results. Sorry! I may try to add options at some point. (See below for more detail on the exact
      rules being observed.)</li>
    <li>Feel free to include spaces between words; they won't affect the calculation.</li>
    <li>More broadly, this program is designed to ignore any character that it doesn't recognize. If you enter text that contains one or more unrecognized characters, you'll see a brief error message, followed by the total <em>abjad</em> value of the parts
      that <em>were</em> counted (<em>i.e.</em>, our best guess). It may be correct nonetheless…</li>
    <li>It's probably best not to include diacritics, or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_alif" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>dagger alif</em></a>, or anything else outside of the "full letters." Only the latter are counted in the <em>abjad</em>      system, anyway, so why add complication?</li>
    <li>If you're confident that you entered valid text in Arabic or Persian script, but you still received an error message, then please let me know <a href="mailto:tbeers@uchicago.edu">by email</a>. It might be a bug! (There are guaranteed to be some at
      this stage.)</li>

  <h4>Specific Rules Followed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The basics of <em>abjad</em> numerals are covered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Wikipedia entry</a>, and they are observed here faithfully. If one digs a bit deeper, however, questions
      and ambiguities may arise…</li>
    <li>The treatment of the four "Persian letters" (<em>p</em>, <em>ch</em>, <em>zh</em>, <em>g</em>) is actually well established; it's explained in the same Wikipedia entry. You should encounter no problem using Persian text. (Urdu? Pashto? You're on your
      own, at least for the time being.)</li>
    <li>This program treats the Arabic letter <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>tāʾ marbūṭah</em></a> as if it were a <em>hāʾ</em> and assigns it a value of 5. This is due to a general principle in <em>abjad</em>      calculation, that we judge letters by their <em>form</em>, rather than by their pronunciation or other factors.</li>
    <li>Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabic/LearnRW/alif_Maksoorah" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>alif maqṣūrah</em></a> is considered equivalent to <em>yāʾ</em> and assigned a value of 10. (Deal with it!)</li>
    <li>Any full-letter form of <em>hamzah</em> or <em>alif</em> will be assigned a value of 1. This includes <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maddah" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>alif maddah</em></a>, which some people have treated as a "double
      <em>hamzah</em>" with a value of 2. Here we should keep in mind another general principle of <em>abjad</em> numerals: each letter is counted exactly once. Just as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>shaddah</em></a>      is not taken into consideration, nor should <em>alif maddah</em> be granted double value.</li>
  </ul>
