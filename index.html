						<li>I would strongly encourage anyone who knows an Arabic-script language to learn how to type
							in it. This isn't as difficult as one might imagine&thinsp;—&thinsp;especially on mobile
							devices, whose support for various languages is now often more seamless than that of desktop
							operating systems&thinsp;—&thinsp;and it opens up a whole new world of resources online.
							However, if you would like to use this <em>abjad</em> calculator but cannot type your input
							directly, there are a couple of alternatives. First, Google has developed clever tools for
							both <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/ar/inputtools/try/" rel="noopener"
								target="_blank">Arabic</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/fa/inputtools/try/"
								rel="noopener" target="_blank">Persian</a> that allow you to enter a phonetic
							approximation of your intended words in Roman script, and then transliterate them with
							little fuss. You could use one of these tools and copy-paste the result into the box above.
							The second fallback option is actually a <a href="ime/">separate version</a> of this page,
							in which buttons may be used to enter Arabic or Persian words one letter at a time.
						</li>
						<li>By default, this program will assign an <em>abjad</em> value of 1 to the isolated form of
							<em>hamzah</em> (ء), treating it the same as if it were placed on an <em>alif</em>. Since
							this is not a universally agreed-upon practice, there is a checkbox to allow for the
							isolated <em>hamzah</em> to be ignored in calculation. (Please refer to the following
							section for more information on this dilemma and others like it.)</li>
						<li>I've set the default letter values according to the more common "Eastern" convention. There
							is now an option to switch to the Maghribi order using a checkbox, for those who need it.
							Please refer to <a href="table/">this table</a> for a reminder of the differences between
							the two systems. (Only you can determine which of them is required by your sources.)
						</li>
						<li>Feel free to include spaces between words, or even <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner" rel="noopener"
								target="_blank">zero-width non-joiners</a>; they won't affect the calculation.
						</li>
						<li>More broadly, the program is designed to ignore any character that it doesn't recognize. If
							you enter a string of text containing one or more unrecognized characters, you'll see a
							brief error message, followed by the total <em>abjad</em> value of the parts that
							<em>were</em> counted&thinsp;—&thinsp;<em>i.e.</em>, our best guess. It may be correct
							nonetheless…</li>
						<li>I recommend that you not include punctuation, or diacritics, or <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagger_alif" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dagger
								<em>alif</em>s</a>, or anything else outside of the "base letters." Only the last
							category is counted in the <em>abjad</em> system, anyway, so why add complication?
						</li>
						<li>If you're confident that you entered valid text in Arabic or Persian script, but you still
							received an error message, please let me know <a href="mailto:tbeers@uchicago.edu">by
								email</a>. It might be a bug! (There are likely to be a few at this stage.)

					<ul>
						<li>The fundamentals of <em>abjad</em> numerals are covered in <a
								href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad_numerals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this
								Wikipedia entry</a>, and they are observed here faithfully. (I've also posted a <a
								href="table/">table of letter values</a>.) If one digs a bit deeper, however, questions
							and ambiguities may arise…
						</li>
						<li>The treatment of the four "Persian letters"&thinsp;—&thinsp;<em>pe</em>, <em>che</em>,
							<em>zhe</em>, and <em>gāf</em>&thinsp;—&thinsp;is, in fact, well established. Please refer
							to the same Wikipedia entry. In general, there should be no problem using Persian text.
							(Urdu? Pashto? You're on your own for the time being.)</li>
						<li>Actually, there is one potentially confusing point in Persian: the <a
								href="https://sites.la.utexas.edu/persian_online_resources/phonology/silent-letters-silent-and-consonantal/"
								rel="noopener" target="_blank">silent <em>hā’</em></a>. But the answer is to treat this
							letter as we would any other <em>hā’</em>. (See the following note for the reasoning behind
							this.) Also, if you are among the stubborn few who use the Unicode character
							<code>06C0</code> (ۀ) to represent <em>iżāfah</em> on a silent <em>hā’</em>, that will be
							recognized just the same.
						</li>
						<li>This program treats the Arabic letter <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A9"
								rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>tā’ marbūṭah</em></a> as if it were <em>hā’</em> and
							assigns it a value of 5. This is due to a general principle in <em>abjad</em> calculation,
							that we judge letters by their <em>form</em> (<em>rasm</em>), rather than by their
							pronunciation or other factors.
						</li>
						<li>Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Arabic/LearnRW/alif_Maksoorah"
								rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>alif maqṣūrah</em></a> is considered equivalent to
							<em>yā’</em> and assigned a value of 10. (Deal with it!)
						</li>
						<li>The treatment of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamza" rel="noopener"
								target="_blank"><em>hamzah</em></a> is most troublesome of all, since it appears in
							conjunction with several different letters. But we need only continue to prioritize form.
							<em>Hamzah</em> on <em>wāw</em> (ؤ) is given the value of <em>wāw</em> (6). <em>Hamzah</em>
							on <em>yā’</em> (ئ) is given the value of <em>yā’</em> (10). Any variant of <em>hamzah</em>
							on <em>alif</em>, unsurprisingly, receives a value of 1. Finally, as was explained in the
							prior section, this program <em>does</em> assign a value of 1 to the isolated form of
							<em>hamzah</em> (ء), which is most often found at the end of certain Arabic words. This is a
							debated point; a few of the guides that I consulted are adamant that <em>hamzah</em> by
							itself should not be counted, since the appropriate value comes from the letter on which it
							is seated. In the end, I took the position of the Baha'i community. It has long been
							symbolically important in their faith that the name Bahā’ (بهاء) has an <em>abjad</em> value
							of 9, which requires that the final <em>hamzah</em> be counted. Users who don't want this
							feature may disable it with the relevant checkbox.
						</li>
						<li>I should emphasize that any form of <em>alif</em> will be given a value of 1. This includes
							<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/maddah" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>alif
									maddah</em></a>, which some have treated as a "double <em>hamzah alif</em>&thinsp;"
							with a value of 2. Here we may invoke another general principle of <em>abjad</em> numerals:
							each letter is counted exactly once. Just as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadda"
								rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>shaddah</em></a> is not taken into consideration, nor
							should <em>alif maddah</em> be granted double value.
						</li>
